Ok guys, I finally did it. With this program you will be able to translate your renpy games into any language you want without any errors.



first of all you need a renpy translation extractor. i recommend zenpy. if you set the target language to the same language as the game, the program will automatically extract only the translation files.



then start the program named renpytranslater

You can select the target language from this bar ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/01b46677-7a9a-4522-914a-fd969f7c2308)


if you are developing very large projects (1 million lines of text) you can use a proxy provider and translate without any problems. since I don't have a proxy, I don't know if this part works or not since I haven't tried this part

ok now it's time to select the part where you select the translate folders you extracted with zenpy, paloslios or renpy sdk. select your folder from this button ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e2576698-f6cf-488f-b4cb-7735e624fb36)


when you select a folder, this will show up ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a2d278a5-3f87-40c2-a3f6-e21c373f7221)

if you choose correctly the translation folder, this panel will show you the .rpy files inside the folder of your choice. ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dd9a3629-b72b-4415-af60-0273f5b8869f)

when you are ready, just click this button for starting translation ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bd2e0d51-c179-491c-9837-ffcfc4f4968d)




When the translation is finished, a message box will appear to inform you that the translation is finished.  then you should start coderepair.exe to solve translation problems. just select the file you are translating







the program is new, and I don't have a lot of experience in programming, so of course there will be errors. please let me know when you get errors.
